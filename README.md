# rbfn

rbfn is a set of python classes built to help with data filtration using RBFN (Radial Basis Function Network) for a real and monodimensionaly signal.
You can:
  - Calculate and store RBFN weigths
  - Plot and store trained and tested data
  - Use simply statistical functions to make initials analisys from datasets
  - Merge more datasets with same signal size

rbfn uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [scipy] - to perform linear algebra algorithms
* [numpy] - to perform matrix analisy
* [os] - module to manipolate folders ans files.
* [matplotlib] - to help with plots
* [sklearn] - module to integrate machine learning
